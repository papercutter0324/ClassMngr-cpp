# Project Progress

Active deployment plan: Qt Rewrite Phase 1 — Build System and Repository Structure.
Current deployment: qt1_build_structure_20260918. Route: Heavy. Commit each
completed slice before starting the next.

## Goal

Establish the parallel ClassMngrNext build, architectural target boundaries,
explicit source ownership, dependency checks, and reproducible Debug, Release,
and platform build flows while keeping the existing ClassMngr production
target buildable through cutover.

## Overall Progress

Phase 0 completed on 2026-09-18. The combined route gate passed all 24 required
routes on Windows x64 and macOS universal, and the user confirmed the retained
visual references. The Phase 0 plan update in commit f8bb5954 records this
closure; earlier Phase 0 open notes are superseded.

Phase 1 slice 1.1 adds a Qt Core-only ClassMngrNext console bootstrap and a
focused CTest launch probe. It has no window and does not link the legacy
runtime.

Slice 1.2 establishes explicit next-generation layer and feature interface
targets in `cmake/next.cmake`. Configure-time assertions enforce the planned
dependency edges. The targets are intentionally source-free at this stage;
`ClassMngrNext` remains independently linked only to Qt Core.

Slice 1.3 measured Qt/Zlib header dependencies per legacy production object
target and moved those modules out of the shared build-settings target. The
legacy runtime keeps the complete module union required to link the current
application and tests.

Slice 1.4 replaces recursive production source discovery with explicit lists
for all six legacy object targets, the two executable entry points, and the
calendar QML files. Included roster `.inc` fragments are explicit header-only
inputs. A configure-time ownership check compares the handwritten `src` and
active test inventories with their targets; shared schedule test doubles now
have one object-library owner each.

Slice 1.5 adds scoped formatting/static-analysis CI for `src/next`, compile
database validation, a configure-time Qt Core-only link assertion for
`ClassMngrNext`, generated Qt-module and resource-pack reports, resource
reference checks, staged-package build reports in the Release workflows, and
startup/memory/performance CTest labels. A clean Windows Ninja/MSVC Debug
configure and full build passed (351 steps); `ClassMngrNextLaunch` passed
(1/1). The module report lists only `Qt6::Core` for `ClassMngrNext`; the
resource check passed for six generated RCC packs and seven runtime IDs, and
the staged-package report probe passed. Cross-platform CI and local
`clang-format`/`clang-tidy` were not run.

## Current Position

Slice 1.4's clean Ninja/MSVC Debug configure and targeted build succeeded for
ClassMngr, ClassMngrNext, and all five tests that consume the shared schedule
stubs. The configure-time ownership check validated 653 handwritten files for
the Windows configuration. `ClassMngrNextLaunch` and those five test programs
passed CTest (6/6). Slice 1.5 is implemented and locally verified on Windows;
its cross-platform CI and clang checks remain unverified. Phase 1 remains in
progress, and slice 1.6, build configurations, follows only after committing
slice 1.5.

## Next Milestone

Commit slice 1.5 before starting slice 1.6. Keep next-generation target names
distinct from legacy object targets such as ClassMngrDomain and
ClassMngrUiShared.
