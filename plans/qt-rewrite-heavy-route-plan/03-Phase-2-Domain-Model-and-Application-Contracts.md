# Phase 2 — Domain Model and Application Contracts

Read [00-Start-Here.md](00-Start-Here.md) first for the overall plan, workflow, and phase sequence.

## Mandatory route for new and resumed work

- Use the Heavy route for every task, slice, follow-up, and reopened gate in this phase. `Default route: Heavy` is a binding instruction.
- At each start or resume, explicitly select Heavy and reread this phase plan and [00-Start-Here.md](00-Start-Here.md). Follow the active `AGENTS.md` Heavy-route instructions and `~/.codex/codex_workflow/heavy_route.md`, including their delegation, verification, and deployment-state requirements.
- A new session, handoff, or context reset does not change the route. Do not continue under Light or Medium. If a required Heavy-route step blocks progress, report the blocker before implementation instead of silently switching routes.

## Status

- Status: In progress
- Default route: Heavy
- Depends on: Phase 1
- Blocks: Persistence, bootstrap, shared UI, and feature migration
- Owner: Unassigned
- Last updated: 2026-09-29
- Historical progress log: [03-Phase-2-Progress-Log.md](03-Phase-2-Progress-Log.md)
- Exit gate: Open
- Current note: F144 is acceptance-complete. Its partial implementation is
  captured in checkpoint `56c76f412b246230fcfe00c249b195dcc6ccd95f`; the
  acceptance test update is committed as
  `89fbbaa250ddf98fae2ab1d80385fb99164ac055`. The F144 Application query,
  Platform adapter, and TestingClassesPage CTests passed 3/3. The F142/F143
  Application and Platform regression CTests passed 4/4 in a separate fresh
  short-path Ninja build. See the F144 acceptance record below for verification
  limits. F145 has no distinct selected scope; complete the Heavy-route
  candidate review before assigning it. The completed F144 scope moved
  `TestingClassesPage::populateTeachers()` from `TeacherService::teachers()`
  to a Qt-free typed Application teacher-choice query/snapshot and active-
  session Platform adapter reading
  `DatabaseSession::teacherRepository()->getAllTeachers()`. Preserve repository
  order, typed teacher IDs, trimmed Korean labels/rooms, blank-Korean-name
  filtering, selected-ID restoration, the “None” row, silent unavailable
  session, and existing “Load Teachers” warning title and generic/detail
  read-failure behavior. Acceptance: app-less typed/query-result/error
  propagation; Platform active-session field/order mapping, unavailable
  `NotFound`, and repository-failure behavior without fallback; page
  labels/IDs/room role, filtering/order/selection/None/warning/silence. This
  read closes the manager page's read path; create/update/delete writes stay
  separate pending acceptance for roster-order and assignment/cascade
  semantics.
  F120 active-v2 DataService isolation and formal workspace-create acceptance
  remain Satisfied. Gates 1 and 2 remain Partial. Historical workbook
  provenance remains a tracked risk, not a literal exit criterion. Sub Prep
  remains January 1 of the reference date's year through December 31 of the
  following year at most; 2026-2027 is illustrative.

## Objective

Create a stable, testable application core that is independent of widget construction, page visibility, and the legacy data facade.

## Work packages

### 2.1 Domain value types

Create explicit value types for:

- Workspace identifiers.
- Teacher and staff records.
- Class and course records.
- Class times and schedule entries.
- Students and rosters.
- Campuses and locations.
- Calendar events.
- Speaking evaluations and criteria.
- Document catalog entries, document-content references, and templates.
- Import matches and conflicts.
- User preferences.

Use typed identifiers and enums instead of unrelated strings that happen to contain IDs or state values.

### 2.2 Structured results

Replace loosely typed return values with structured results:

- Success values.
- Recoverable warnings.
- User-facing errors.
- Technical errors.
- Validation failures.
- Import conflicts.
- Cancellation state.

An import result, for example, should separately expose imported records, warnings, unmatched values, and conflicts.

### 2.3 Application use cases

Create use cases for:

- Creating, opening, closing, saving, and exporting a workspace.
- Importing a legacy database.
- Importing teachers, schedules, calendars, rosters, and class transfers.
- Editing teachers, classes, schedules, calendar events, rosters, and evaluations.
- Generating reports and substitute documents.
- Listing campus and document metadata.
- Opening document content on demand for a viewer or output operation.
- Performing backups and recovery.
- Checking for application updates after startup.

The Sub Prep slice also requires explicit summary, selected-detail, and
operation-scoped print-source contracts. Their feature-level implementation
plan is tracked in [Sub Prep Class Information and Output Memory
Plan](sub-prep-class-information-memory-plan.md).

Each use case must have:

- Explicit input.
- Explicit output.
- Structured errors.
- No widget references.
- No hidden singleton state.
- A deterministic test boundary.

### 2.4 Validation and business rules

Move validation rules into domain or application services.

The UI may display validation results and choose when to validate, but it must not own the business rule implementation.

Preserve current validation messages and behavior until visual and behavioral parity is accepted.

### 2.5 State and concurrency

Define:

- Workspace session state.
- Unsaved-change state.
- Current selection state.
- Import-job state.
- Report/export-job state.
- Document-content session state: requested, loading, ready, failed, and released.
- Cancellation behavior.
- Thread ownership.

Background work must return results through application interfaces. Worker code must not mutate widgets directly.

### 2.6 Memory-safe projections and operation contracts

The [Qt Rewrite Memory Hotspot Remediation
Plan](memory-hotspot-remediation-plan.md) defines the compact contracts needed
by the large-data slices. Add application-facing projections equivalent to:

- compact class and teacher summaries plus selected class details;
- a compact schedule view projection;
- an import review session containing matching indexes and compact decisions,
  not the original workbook and every derived UI object;
- staged transfer-reader and transfer-writer records;
- operation-scoped report and PDF render sources.

Every contract must state which layer owns the data, when raw or derived
representations may overlap, and when they are released. Contracts must not
return widget trees, page pointers, or broad compatibility-service snapshots.

## Deliverables

- Domain model library.
- Application use-case library.
- Structured error and warning types.
- Validation services.
- Application-state definitions.
- Domain tests that run without a QApplication.
- Mapping document from old service calls to new use cases.

## Exit gate

Domain and application behavior can be tested without constructing the main window.

Validation, conflict detection, import planning, and state transitions match the baseline fixtures.

For the workspace boundary, acceptance includes the current
`WorkspaceGateway::createWorkspace` contract and `WorkspaceCoordinator` create
behavior: dirty replacement is rejected before the gateway, a successful
session opens `WorkspaceState` and clears `SelectionState`, and gateway or
invalid-session failures preserve both snapshots. The existing app-less
`NextApplicationContractTests` and `NextApplicationWorkspaceCoordinatorTests`
cover these create paths alongside open, close, save, save-as, and export.

No new v2 production path depends on DataService, MainWindow, PageManager, or a widget pointer.

## Heavy-route requirements

- For every Phase 2 slice, use the heavy route: implement the contract across
  its intended v2 boundary, verify it with the owning layers, and remove any
  temporary compatibility wrapper when the slice is accepted.
- Convert core contracts rather than wrapping every old Qt type indefinitely.
- Keep Qt conversion at the UI, filesystem, or platform boundary.
- Prefer explicit immutable snapshots for read models.
- Keep document-content contracts independent of QtPdf; the viewer/platform
  adapter owns the active document session and its release boundary.
- Do not hide business rules inside presenters or delegates.
- Do not allow compatibility methods to become the permanent v2 API.

## Latest verified progress (F143; commit `e2a3811cdba71b58ff2289f2c756d9bf12349bf5`)

F143 adds the Qt-free `TestingClassDetailsReadQuery`, typed snapshot, and
handler. Its Platform adapter reads the selected record directly through the
active `DatabaseSession`'s
`TestingClassRepository::loadTestingClass()`. `TestingClassesPage::loadClass()`
uses this boundary instead of a `ScheduleService` detail read. The result keeps
class ID, name, grade, level, room, teacher ID, class/font colors, and notes;
roster loading, success state, and warning behavior remain intact. An
unavailable session returns silent `NotFound`; missing/read errors remain
warnings. Nonpositive teacher IDs map to absence, preserving the editor's
“None” row.

Independent fresh Windows x64 Debug Ninja/MSVC/Qt 6.12 verification in
`C:\Users\wfelt\AppData\Local\Temp\codex_f143_testing_class_details_20260929`
validated 1,021 handwritten source owners. The build succeeded for
`ClassMngrNextApplicationTestingClassDetailsReadQueryTests`,
`ClassMngrNextPlatformApplicationServicesTestingClassDetailsReadPortTests`,
and `ClassMngrTestingClassesPageTests`; the exact focused CTest selection passed
3/3 (0.10s, 0.89s, 1.64s). App-less tests cover typed-ID/result propagation;
Platform tests cover field mapping, absent/zero teacher, unavailable/missing/
read-error behavior, and no fallback; the page test covers fields, roster,
success, silence/warnings, the zero-ID “None” row, and the F142 list regression.
No full suite or baseline comparison ran. Source/test commit
`e2a3811cdba71b58ff2289f2c756d9bf12349bf5`.

F143 adds Gate 1 application behavior evidence and no Gate 2 baseline-parity
evidence. F120 active-v2 DataService isolation and the formal workspace-create
boundary remain Satisfied. Phase 2 remains In Progress with its exit gate Open.
Historical production-workbook provenance remains a tracked risk, not a
literal exit criterion. Sub Prep remains bounded to January 1 of the reference
date's year through December 31 of the following year at most; 2026-2027 is
illustrative.

### Cumulative exit-gate status after F143

| Exit-gate area | Audit status | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App-less Domain/Application behavior (Gate 1) | Partial | Coverage includes workspace lifecycle; Class Transfer schedule-candidate validation (F79); Teacher Import (F80/F81/F85/F87/F89/F90); Schedule Import match-key typing (F84); Calendar policies/use cases (F93/F95/F97/F99/F101-F105/F107/F110); teacher-profile editing (F117/F123); co-teacher assignment (F124); class-notes save (F125); Classes navigation snapshot (F133); ScheduleBuilder source snapshot (F134); slot-state and testing-assignment reads (F135/F136); testing-class choices and TestingClasses list reads (F138/F142); ScheduleEditor save and class-info read (F139/F140); and TestingClasses selected-detail read (F143). Broader class-detail, schedule, roster, and evaluation editing, backup/recovery, and legacy database import remain planned. |
| Baseline parity (Gate 2) | Partial | Bounded records include F82/F83 post-baseline Schedule Import inputs, F86/F88 baseline-era generated Schedule Import inputs, F91/F92/F94/F96/F98 Teacher Import flows and failure cases, F100/F101/F103/F104/F106/F108/F109 Schedule Import rollback and Calendar repository transitions, F118 common-input Class Transfer conflict behavior, F121 common-input successful replacement state, and F122 hand-authored seeded Schedule Import Skip state parity. They do not cover all validation, conflict, planning, or state-transition behavior; historical production-workbook provenance remains unverified. |
| Workspace boundary | Satisfied | The formal workspace-create criterion remains satisfied. |
| v2 dependency isolation | Satisfied for active `src/next` call paths | F120 removes the Workspace operation edge to `DataService`; the source audit confirms all seven operations route to `DatabaseSession` or the file helper. Legacy facade construction/access remains available. |

Phase 2 remains In Progress with its exit gate Open. Gate 1 and Gate 2 remain
Partial; historical production-workbook provenance remains a tracked risk, not
a literal exit criterion. Sub Prep remains bounded to January 1 of the
reference date's year through December 31 of the following year, at most;
2026-2027 is illustrative.

## F144 acceptance record

F144 moves `TestingClassesPage::populateTeachers()` from
`TeacherService::teachers()` to a Qt-free typed Application query and a
Platform adapter that reads
`DatabaseSession::teacherRepository()->getAllTeachers()`. It preserves
repository order, typed teacher IDs, trimmed Korean labels and rooms, blank
label filtering, ID-based selection restoration, the None row, silent
unavailable-session behavior, and the existing failure warning.

The partial production/test implementation is checkpointed at
`56c76f412b246230fcfe00c249b195dcc6ccd95f`; the final page-test update is in
acceptance test commit
`89fbbaa250ddf98fae2ab1d80385fb99164ac055`.

Each fresh Windows x64 Debug Ninja/MSVC 19.51/Qt 6.12 configure, with
`BUILD_TESTING=ON`, validated 1,025 handwritten source owners. The F144
Application query, Platform adapter, and `ClassMngrTestingClassesPageTests`
targets built and passed CTest 3/3 in
`build/phase2-f144-independent-ninja-x64-20260929`. The F142/F143 Application
and Platform regression targets built and passed CTest 4/4 in the separate
short-path tree `build/p2-f142f143`. All seven focused CTest cases passed.
`git diff --check` passed. No full suite or full `ClassMngr`
application build ran.

An earlier F142/F143 Platform build attempt failed before test execution with
MSVC C1083; the separate fresh short-path build passed without reproducing it.
The cause is unknown. The null-`teacherRepository()` defensive branch has no
direct test seam while an open `DatabaseSession` exists; null services,
unopened sessions, and closed sessions cover the observable unavailable case.
No production defect was observed.

F143 remains the preceding accepted slice. F145 has no distinct selected
scope; complete the Heavy-route candidate review before assigning it. Testing
Classes create/update/delete writes remain separate because roster-order and
assignment/cascade semantics still need acceptance.
