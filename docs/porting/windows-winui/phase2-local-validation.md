# Phase 2 local validation record

Date: 2026-08-30 (Asia/Seoul)

Scope: Phase 2 portable-engine slices on the clean Phase 1 working tree.

## Extracted contract

`classmngr::engine::DatabaseFileFormat` now owns the `.tps`/legacy `.db`
path rules using UTF-8 `std::string_view` inputs and `std::string` outputs.
The retained Qt `DatabaseFileFormat` namespace is a conversion adapter only;
it no longer contains the extension, case, or suffix rules.

The Qt-free `ClassMngrEngine` target includes the contract and has a dedicated
headless test executable covering native and legacy paths, case-insensitive
extensions, UTF-8 names, directory names containing dots, blank paths, and
extensionless inputs.

`classmngr::engine::Error` and `Result<T>` now provide typed error codes,
UTF-8 messages, and optional native codes for persistence-facing APIs.
`classmngr::engine::SqliteDatabase` keeps SQLite handles private and provides
prepared parameter binding, typed integer/real/text/blob/null rows, a
configurable `std::chrono` busy timeout, foreign-key initialization, schema
version primitives, and RAII transaction rollback/commit. Windows links the
architecture-matched Windows SDK `winsqlite3` library; non-Windows builds use
the CMake SQLite3 package/target.

## Local validation

| Lane | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Windows x64 Debug engine tests | Passed: `ClassMngrEngineTests` and `ClassMngrEngineDatabaseFileFormatTests` |
| Windows x64 Release engine tests | Passed: `ClassMngrEngineTests` and `ClassMngrEngineDatabaseFileFormatTests` |
| Windows x86 Debug engine tests | Passed: `ClassMngrEngineTests` and `ClassMngrEngineDatabaseFileFormatTests` |
| Windows x86 Release engine tests | Passed: `ClassMngrEngineTests` and `ClassMngrEngineDatabaseFileFormatTests` |
| Retained Windows Qt file-format test | Passed: `ClassMngrDatabaseFileFormatTests` |
| Windows x64 Debug SQLite foundation test | Passed: `ClassMngrEngineSqliteDatabaseTests` |
| Windows x64 Release SQLite foundation test | Passed: `ClassMngrEngineSqliteDatabaseTests` |
| Windows x86 Debug SQLite foundation test | Passed: `ClassMngrEngineSqliteDatabaseTests` |
| Windows x86 Release SQLite foundation test | Passed: `ClassMngrEngineSqliteDatabaseTests` |

All four engine lanes configured or regenerated successfully after the engine
source addition, compiled the new implementation, and passed the targeted
CTest selections with no Qt-dependent test process. The x64 Debug integrated
sweep also passed all three engine suites plus both WinUI staging and manifest
checks. The retained Qt adapter compiled and passed its existing Qt test, and
the x64 Debug and x86 Release staged WinUI targets rebuilt successfully with
the new engine dependency. A narrowed source audit found no Qt, WinUI, WinRT,
Direct2D/DirectWrite, or Win32 UI dependency in `src/engine`.

## Remaining Phase 2 work

This is an in-progress record, not the Phase 2 exit gate. The next work is
extracting the schema manager and migration behavior into the new boundary,
then the first engine use case and a cross-platform fixture round trip.
